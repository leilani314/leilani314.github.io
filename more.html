<a href="https://lpsspace.wordpress.com">My blog, lp's space, lives on Wordpress.</a> I do not have a good
vision for the blog and have decided to let myself write about whatever I want. Math will probably 
make an appearance.
</p>
<p>Like many mathematicians, I am also a musician. As an
undergraduate, I marched with <a href="https://uscband.usc.edu/">
The Greatest Marching Band in the History of 
the Universe (Ever!)</a> and served as a section
leader for the trumpet section during my senior year. 
More recently, I've been spotted playing trumpet 
with the Lincoln-based band <a href="http://floatingopera.com/">
Floating Opera</a>.</p>
<p>
I am roommates with a very nice cat named Frederick, pictured at right 
doing some difficult thinking about games and graphs.
