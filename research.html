<h1>Research</h1>

<p>
In mathematics, 
I am primarily interested in random graphs/hypergraphs and 
their applications. I also enjoy learning about 
math education, computer science (and particularly 
its overlap with mathematics), and discrete 
math in general.</p>

<br>
<h2>Random Hypergraphs</h2>

<p>
I am currently thinking about the threshold for 
the appearance of perfect matchings
(and, with any luck, Hamilton cycles) 
in k-uniform, k-partite random hypergraphs. This
work is a variation on Shamir's problem, which asks, 
roughly, how many edges we need to include in a random
hypergraph to be (asymptotically almost) sure that it 
contains a perfect matching.
</p>

<p>
In a collaboration started at 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/grwc" target="_blank">
GRWC</a>,  I worked with 
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmacrury/" target="_blank">
Calum MacRury</a>, 
<a href="http://tarken.krakonos.org/" target="_blank">
Tomáš Masařík</a>, and
<a href="https://www.math.unl.edu/~xperezgimenez2/" target="_blank">
Xavier Pérez-Giménez</a>
on studying discrepancy in two models of random hypergraph.
The discrepancy of a hypergraph is, in some sense, a measure
of how well we can balance a vertex-coloring over the 
hypergraph's edges.

<h2>STEM Education</h2>

<p>
In education research, I have worked on two projects related to 
elementary STEM teaching: one focused on developing STEM teacher 
leaders, and another on teaching computer science in particular. 
I have experience with interviewing K-8 teachers, conducting 
literature searches, and coding and further analyzing 
qualitative data.
</p>

<p>
My experiences as a discrete mathematician and a college math 
instructor have stoked my interest in studying issues related 
to undergraduate and graduate mathematics education, as well as 
teaching discrete mathematics in particular. I am especially 
interested in exploring how students and instructors interact 
in undergraduate discrete mathematics courses. This could serve 
as a stepping-stone to understanding the role that discrete math 
could play in the equitable teaching of mathematics.
