<h1>Research</h1>

<p>
My doctoral degree is in mathematics, and I wrote my dissertation about random hypergraphs. Now, most of my research focuses on STEM education, although I still do a small amount of work in discrete math (and in particular graph theory). Denison students who are interested in working with me on a research project, whether in education or in discrete math, should email me or drop by my office to introduce themselves.
</p>

<h2>STEM Education</h2>

<p>
My experiences as a discrete mathematician and a college math 
instructor have stoked my interest in studying issues related 
to undergraduate and graduate mathematics education. My current research focuses on
undergraduate mathematics education, as well as STEM education more 
broadly, with an emphasis on understanding how students' various and intersecting identities influence their experiences in
mathematics departments and programs.
</p>

<p>
I believe that critical viewpoints are necessary to understand issues 
of equity and inclusion within schools and departments. As I develop as an
education researcher, I am interested in leveraging such perspectives to 
investigate the intersection between university mathematics departments, 
teaching, and equity---how can we support professional <em>mathematicians</em> in seeing themselves as educators bearing 
responsibility for equity, inclusion, and justice; and, conversely, 
how can we support professional <em>educators</em> in seeing themselves 
as mathematicians with the power to make change in math spaces?

<h2>Graph Theory</h2>

<p>
My dissertation is about the threshold for 
the appearance of perfect matchings
in k-uniform, k-partite random hypergraphs. This
work is a variation on Shamir's problem, which asks, 
roughly, how many edges we need to include in a random
hypergraph to be (asymptotically almost) sure that it 
contains a perfect matching.
</p>

<p>
I have also explored other problems in graph theory and combinatorics at
